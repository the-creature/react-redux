That said, stopping the pill is not as scary as it may seem. Here’s how dumping your systemic contraceptive might affect your body.<\/p><h2>Chemistry Class.&nbsp;<\/h2><p>It helps to think of post birth-control changes in terms of a reversion: stopping the effects of estrogen and/or progestin undoes changes caused by the compounds. Identifying these changes will help inform what to expect when you might want to start expecting.<\/p><p>Hormonal birth control works by flatlining the chemical changes that lead to ovulation, such that the body’s monthly march to pregnancy can be forestalled. Think of it like sledding: you gotta climb a hill before you can slide down it.<\/p><p><img data-original-width=\"316\" data-original-height=\"178\" data-padding-top=\"136\" data-id=\"GbAQyroDX4kak\" url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/GbAQyroDX4kak/giphy.gif\" data-still=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/GbAQyroDX4kak/giphy_s.gif\" data-preview-image-url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/GbAQyroDX4kak/100.gif\" id=\"GbAQyroDX4kak\" data-absolute-url=\"/gifs/winter-pugs-sledding-GbAQyroDX4kak\" data-edit-url=\"/gifs/winter-pugs-sledding-GbAQyroDX4kak/edit\" alt=\"Cheezburger sledding winter pugs\" width=\"805\" height=\"453.449367089\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/GbAQyroDX4kak/giphy.gif\" /><\/p><p>Birth control turns an exhilarating sled run into a long, boring stretch of mesa. All of which begs the question: what happens when the hormones start sledding again?<\/p><h2>Stormy Weather.&nbsp;<\/h2><p>For many women with tempestuous menses, birth control can bring a blessed calm thanks to the hormonal stability offered by the Pill. Some women on the Pill experience relief of period woes, as <a href=\"https://bedsider.org/features/284-period-pain-birth-control-can-help\">the Pill causes lighter periods<\/a> by thinning the uterine lining. Less lining to shed, less bleeding, less pain.<\/p><p><img data-original-width=\"488\" data-original-height=\"275\" data-padding-top=\"87\" data-id=\"OUryBN7dqHqMg\" url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/OUryBN7dqHqMg/giphy.gif\" data-still=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/OUryBN7dqHqMg/giphy_s.gif\" data-preview-image-url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/OUryBN7dqHqMg/100.gif\" id=\"OUryBN7dqHqMg\" data-absolute-url=\"/gifs/tina-fey-sick-period-OUryBN7dqHqMg\" data-edit-url=\"/gifs/tina-fey-sick-period-OUryBN7dqHqMg/edit\" alt=\"tina fey sick ill period 30 rock\" width=\"805\" height=\"453.637295082\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/OUryBN7dqHqMg/giphy.gif\" /><\/p><p>It follows that by going off birth control, a woman’s experience with her monthly bleed would revert to it’s pre-contraceptive state. And often times, it does. However, this isn’t always the case;&nbsp;a woman’s cycle changes over the course of her life, so you could be in for a surprise if it’s been awhile since you had a non-birth control mediated period.<\/p><p>Suprise!<\/p><h2>Slippery Business.<\/h2><p>One of the effects of progestin is that it results in<a href=\"https://courses.washington.edu/conj/bess/contraception/contraception.htm\"> thickened cervical mucus<\/a>, making it harder for sperm to thrash furiously egg-ward. <img data-original-width=\"400\" data-original-height=\"225\" data-padding-top=\"112\" data-id=\"6XAb40aDl9Pr2\" url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/6XAb40aDl9Pr2/giphy.gif\" data-still=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/6XAb40aDl9Pr2/giphy_s.gif\" data-preview-image-url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/6XAb40aDl9Pr2/100.gif\" id=\"6XAb40aDl9Pr2\" data-absolute-url=\"/gifs/obama-taiwanese-animation-nmatv-6XAb40aDl9Pr2\" data-edit-url=\"/gifs/obama-taiwanese-animation-nmatv-6XAb40aDl9Pr2/edit\" alt=\"sperm morning after pill obama pregnant taiwanese animation\" width=\"805\" height=\"452.8125\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/6XAb40aDl9Pr2/giphy.gif\" /><\/p><p>However, without the progestin in birth control, the body exhibits several types of cervical mucus per cycle, making it so that the reproductive tract is most hospitable to sperm around the time of ovulation. And what do sperm like?

The pill can increase water retention, leading to fuller breasts; if you notice some breast deflation occurring during the placebo week, the size increase is probably just water and won’t stay post-BC. However, estrogen can cause breast tissue growth, so the added plumpness might stick around.<\/p><h3>...make me break out?<\/h3><p><img data-original-width=\"717\" data-original-height=\"400\" data-padding-top=\"25\" data-id=\"MSSx1CatVWYik\" url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/MSSx1CatVWYik/giphy.gif\" data-still=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/MSSx1CatVWYik/giphy_s.gif\" data-preview-image-url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/MSSx1CatVWYik/100.gif\" id=\"MSSx1CatVWYik\" data-absolute-url=\"/gifs/funny-zit-MSSx1CatVWYik\" data-edit-url=\"/gifs/funny-zit-MSSx1CatVWYik/edit\" alt=\"zit\" width=\"805\" height=\"449\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/MSSx1CatVWYik/giphy.gif\" /><\/p><p>Quite possibly. <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/acne/birth-control-for-acne-treatment\">Hormonal birth control lowers testosterone levels<\/a>, which can sooth acneic skin by decreasing sebum (oil) production. If going on the pill cleared up your breakouts, chances are they will return once you discontinue the medication.<\/p><h3>...make me less attracted to my partner?<\/h3><p><img data-original-width=\"500\" data-original-height=\"239\" data-padding-top=\"105\" data-id=\"6ZrItSkqs5stO\" url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/6ZrItSkqs5stO/giphy.gif\" data-still=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/6ZrItSkqs5stO/giphy_s.gif\" data-preview-image-url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/6ZrItSkqs5stO/100.gif\" id=\"6ZrItSkqs5stO\" data-absolute-url=\"/gifs/woman-attempt-6ZrItSkqs5stO\" data-edit-url=\"/gifs/woman-attempt-6ZrItSkqs5stO/edit\" alt=\"man woman attempt interest\" width=\"805\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/6ZrItSkqs5stO/giphy.gif\" /><\/p><p>Doubtful. The same testosterone-squashing effects of birth control that can improve acne also <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/caseygueren/birth-control-and-your-sex-life#.jvwbNpn81\">flatten out the libido-boosting efforts of the big T<\/a>. Without the Pill, there’s a surge of testosterone mid-cycle, which can make women feel ultra-randy around ovulation. If you used to be horny mid-month, chances are that will come back when you go off birth control.<\/p><p>Testosterone is tied to libido, so having more off it in your system could make you want to bang your partner more. That said, there’s a lot more to attraction than hormone levels, so try not to stress this one too much.<\/p><h3>...make me lose weight?<\/h3><p><img data-original-width=\"400\" data-original-height=\"226\" data-padding-top=\"112\" data-id=\"NicE96IHp4Qpi\" url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/NicE96IHp4Qpi/giphy.gif\" data-still=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/NicE96IHp4Qpi/giphy_s.gif\" data-preview-image-url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/NicE96IHp4Qpi/100.gif\" id=\"NicE96IHp4Qpi\" data-absolute-url=\"/gifs/diet-rhoc-summer-2k15-NicE96IHp4Qpi\" data-edit-url=\"/gifs/diet-rhoc-summer-2k15-NicE96IHp4Qpi/edit\" alt=\"real housewives fat real housewives of orange county rhoc skinny\" width=\"805\" height=\"454.825\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/NicE96IHp4Qpi/giphy.gif\" /><\/p><p>Maybe? Boosting estrogen can lead to weight gain via water retention and increased appetite, and some women report a fuller figure on birth control. However, a systematic review of 44 scientific studies on weight gain and birth control <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060125/full/news060123-4.html\">found no evidence<\/a> that starting the pill causes weight gain. So, if going on the pill may or may not result in weight gain, I think it’s fair to say that going off may or may not result in weight loss.<\/p><h2>A word of caution.&nbsp;<\/h2><p><img data-original-width=\"480\" data-original-height=\"270\" data-padding-top=\"90\" data-id=\"xpgkS4Fhu5hwA\" url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/xpgkS4Fhu5hwA/giphy.gif\" data-still=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/xpgkS4Fhu5hwA/giphy_s.gif\" data-preview-image-url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/xpgkS4Fhu5hwA/100.gif\" id=\"xpgkS4Fhu5hwA\" data-absolute-url=\"/gifs/univisionnoticias-xpgkS4Fhu5hwA\" data-edit-url=\"/gifs/univisionnoticias-xpgkS4Fhu5hwA/edit\" alt=\"Univision Noticias pregnancy sexual health\" width=\"805\" height=\"452.8125\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/xpgkS4Fhu5hwA/giphy.gif\" /><\/p><p>There is a common misconception that there is a sort of grace-period between being on the Pill and being able to get pregnant. This is not true. For methods like the pill, the ring, and the IUD, the hormones suppressing ovulation will be out of the system in a matter of days; for a contraceptive shot, it can take up to six months. From then, it’s a matter of your body’s own hormonal system getting back online. The timeframe for this varies, but it’s possible to get pregnant the first month off birth control, before you even have your first period.<\/p><p>If you’re stopping birth control to get pregnant, you can start trying right away. The fastest it will take to ovulate is about two weeks, assuming your body’s systems come on blasting. Some bodies need a little more time to get ovulating, and it’s normal for a body to take up to three months for her period to return.<\/p><p>But if you’re stopping birth control and you’d rather not get pregnant, it’s important to remember that you most definitely can.

Much of the recent coverage of toxic masculinity has focused on lessons learned in early childhood. Here are some of the ways we reinforce these potentially harmful characteristics in boys.<\/p><h2>1. \"Be a man!\"<\/h2><p><img data-original-width=\"400\" data-original-height=\"170\" data-padding-top=\"140\" data-id=\"lnlgMFZOx446c\" url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/lnlgMFZOx446c/giphy.gif\" data-still=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/lnlgMFZOx446c/giphy_s.gif\" data-preview-image-url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/lnlgMFZOx446c/100.gif\" id=\"lnlgMFZOx446c\" data-absolute-url=\"/gifs/frank-ocean-boys-dont-cry-pls-lnlgMFZOx446c\" data-edit-url=\"/gifs/frank-ocean-boys-dont-cry-pls-lnlgMFZOx446c/edit\" alt=\"frank ocean boys dont cry frank pls\" width=\"805\" height=\"342\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/lnlgMFZOx446c/giphy.gif\" /><\/p><p>In a recent popular <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/education/edlife/teaching-men-to-be-emotionally-honest.html?_r=0\">New York Times article<\/a>, Andrew Reiner, a writing, literature, and cultural studies professor at Towson University, recounts an anecdote that displays how even at a young age, boys are taught to suppress or reinterpret outward emotional displays — be they psychological or physical — in the pursuit of fostering an \"I-can-take-it\" manliness.<\/p><p>The account revolves around a home video of a distraught toddler being vaccinated. His father can be overheard saying, \"Don't cry!...Aw, big boy! High five, high five! Say you're a man: 'I'm a man!'\" As the video ends, the boy, his face contorted in anger, pounds his chest and says through his teeth, \"I'm a man!\"<\/p><p>To Reiner, the video captures, with \"profound concision, the earliest stirrings of a male identity at war with itself.\"<\/p><h2>2. Dominance<\/h2><p><img data-original-width=\"360\" data-original-height=\"202\" data-padding-top=\"124\" data-id=\"ZXiLBZBzwpNaU\" url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/ZXiLBZBzwpNaU/giphy.gif\" data-still=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/ZXiLBZBzwpNaU/giphy_s.gif\" data-preview-image-url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/ZXiLBZBzwpNaU/100.gif\" id=\"ZXiLBZBzwpNaU\" data-absolute-url=\"/gifs/bro-ZXiLBZBzwpNaU\" data-edit-url=\"/gifs/bro-ZXiLBZBzwpNaU/edit\" alt=\"bro\" width=\"805\" height=\"451.694444444\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/ZXiLBZBzwpNaU/giphy.gif\" /><\/p><p>Men and boys are often taught that they should define themselves against \"girliness\" and femininity, but those teachings can have unfortunate consequences, and enforce a divide between the sexes. As educator Tony Porter explains in his <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/tony_porter_a_call_to_men?language=en\">TED Talk<\/a>, these notions teach us \"that men are in charge, which means women are not; that men lead, and you should just follow and just do what we say; that men are superior and women are inferior; that men are strong and women are weak.\"<\/p><h2>3. Suppress your emotions<\/h2><p><img data-original-width=\"500\" data-original-height=\"336\" data-padding-top=\"57\" data-id=\"hAt4kMHnaVeNO\" url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/hAt4kMHnaVeNO/giphy.gif\" data-still=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/hAt4kMHnaVeNO/giphy_s.gif\" data-preview-image-url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/hAt4kMHnaVeNO/100.gif\" id=\"hAt4kMHnaVeNO\" data-absolute-url=\"/gifs/movie-crying-johnny-depp-hAt4kMHnaVeNO\" data-edit-url=\"/gifs/movie-crying-johnny-depp-hAt4kMHnaVeNO/edit\" alt=\"cry baby movie crying johnny depp tear\" width=\"669\" height=\"449\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/hAt4kMHnaVeNO/giphy.gif\" /><\/p><p>Writing in The Times, Reiner notes that the video of the boy's vaccination shows \"how boys are taught, sometimes with the best of intentions, to mutate their emotional suffering into anger.\" Others have noted that these patterns of teaching men to suppress, deny, or mutate their emotions start early, and are often unwittingly enforced.<\/p><p>In \"<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.terryreal.com/store/i-don%E2%80%99t-want-to-talk-about-it\">I Don't Want to Talk About It: Overcoming the Secret Legacy of Male Depression,<\/a>\" psychologist Terry Real writes that \"[a]t the youngest ages, both boys and girls are more like a stereotypical girl.\" However, as Real notes, research suggests that mothers and fathers bring preconceived notions of masculinity to baby boys — often to damaging ends. In one instance, parents were shown video of the same baby crying, but described the emotion on display differently — anger for boys, fear for females — depending on what sex they believed the baby to be. Real concludes:<\/p><blockquote><p>“[F]rom the moment of birth, boys are spoken to less than girls, comforted less, nurtured less.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Teaching boys that natural emotions are somehow unmanly and should be repressed can have obvious <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hold-me-tight/201004/suppressing-emotions\">psychologically damaging impacts<\/a>. But suppressing emotion can also have more tangible, dangerous outcomes, leading to potential <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://psychcentral.com/news/2011/03/24/suppressed-emotions-can-lead-to-aggression/24643.html\">outbursts of aggression<\/a>, and even <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/03/men-die-first-because-of-toxic-masculinity.html\">shorter life spans<\/a>.<\/p><h2>4.Discouraged from seeking help or treatment<\/h2><p><img data-original-width=\"500\" data-original-height=\"281\" data-padding-top=\"84\" data-id=\"3o6gaQQitM8rrsR1za\" url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6gaQQitM8rrsR1za/giphy.gif\" data-still=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6gaQQitM8rrsR1za/giphy_s.gif\" data-preview-image-url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6gaQQitM8rrsR1za/100.gif\" id=\"3o6gaQQitM8rrsR1za\" data-absolute-url=\"/gifs/blunttalk-season-1-starz-blunt-talk-3o6gaQQitM8rrsR1za\" data-edit-url=\"/gifs/blunttalk-season-1-starz-blunt-talk-3o6gaQQitM8rrsR1za/edit\" alt=\"Blunt Talk season 1 starz therapy 01x01\" width=\"805\" height=\"452.41\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6gaQQitM8rrsR1za/giphy.gif\" /><\/p><p>Potentially harmful notions of masculinity are, of course, multifaceted, and tend to bleed into one another. The \"tough guy\" male caricature, for example, might be hard pressed to open up emotionally — both to themselves, and to others that would be able to offer help. At the risk of looking vulnerable or weak, men might <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.apa.org/monitor/jun05/helping.aspx\">chose not to go to therapy<\/a>, seek out help with mental health issues, or even lie at the doctor's office. But at least some studies show that those tendencies could be detrimental: According to <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://news.rutgers.edu/news/tougher-men-think-they-are-less-likely-they-are-be-honest-doctors/20160321#.VvWaVeIrJ9O\">one recent study<\/a> from Rutgers researchers, male aversion to seeking out medical help, paired with a propensity to be less honest with their doctors, could cause an earlier death.<\/p><p><div data-widget=\"survey\" data-survey-id=\"7690\"><\/div><\/p>",
